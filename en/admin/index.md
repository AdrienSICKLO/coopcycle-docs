# Administrator's guide

Welcome to the administrator's guide for CoopCycle platform.

Our software is a complete logistics and e-commerce system allowing the delivery of a product from A to B. Our platform is dedicated to bicycle delivery and its license is designed to reserve the use for worker owned co-operatives only.

The platform is composed of two components:

## Logistics 
Pick up and drop off management organised into a task system (two tasks form a delivery) allowing the following user actions:

- An administrator can assign tasks or task lists to a courier
- An administrator can track the position of a courier in real time from the dispatch screen; adding tasks can be done the day before or in real time
- A courier can receive spots on their smartphone (iOS and Android)
- A courier can mark a task as done or missed and can add a comment
- An administrator can manage the pricing by store (by weight, distance, zone, type of bike)
- A customer can order a delivery on the platform and pay (automated price calculation)

## E-commerce 
Management of restaurants and shops allowing the following user actions:

- A customer can order a meal at a restaurant, by selecting the delivery time and address
- The customer can order via the platform or via the smartphone application
- The restaurant owner receives the order in real time, they can then accept or reject it
- A restaurant owner can mark the order as ready, in this case the courier is notified
- A restaurant owner can manage their menu online
