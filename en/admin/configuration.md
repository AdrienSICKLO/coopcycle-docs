# Configuration of your software

The cooperative which manages and uses the software can configure it according to its needs, with the page `Configuration > Parameters`.

It is possible to:
- Set a brand name which will be displayed in the header and in email signatures
- Set administrator's email address which notifications of new orders will be send to
- Indicate the latitude/longitude of your location in order to center the map on your area of operation
- Configure Stripe (Stripe public key, Stripe secret key, Stripe Connect ID). For more info, take a look at the `Stripe` documentation
- Use Stripe in test and live modes. See the `Stripe` documentation
- Tax (e.g. VAT) rate used for the delivery (set this rate in `Configuration > Taxes`)
