The deliverer must pick up merchandise at an address and bring it to another address. The following information must be completed by the dispatcher for each task:
- Crenellations
- Address
- Commentary
- The following information is used to track the progress of a task in the delivery process:
- Status
- History

## Create a delivery

Assign two or more tasks to a delivery person creating a delivery. When the Retrieve and Drop tasks are created, the dispatcher assigns these tasks manually in the most optimal order that they judge. The creation of a delivery is materialized on the map by means of a GPS track which is proposed to the courier for delivery.
